In this guide we're going to learn how to go from zero to a running Dolos instance with the least amount of effort.

<Steps>
1. ### Installation

    <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="mac">
        You can use Homebrew to install the latest version of Dolos in Mac (both x86 / ARM64)

        ```sh
        brew install txpipe/tap/dolos
        ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="linux">
        You can install Dolos on linux system using the following command:

        ```sh
        curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/txpipe/dolos/releases/latest/download/dolos-installer.sh | sh
        ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="windows">
        You can use Powershell to install Dolos on Windows systems:

        ```sh
        powershell -c "irm https://github.com/txpipe/dolos/releases/latest/download/dolos-installer.ps1 | iex"
        ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="docker">
        _Dolos_ provides public Docker images through Github Packages. To execute _Dolos_ via Docker, use the following command:

        ```sh
        docker run ghcr.io/txpipe/dolos:latest
        ```
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    For more detailed information on how to install Dolos, check the [installation section](./installation)

2. ### Configuration

    To configure _Dolos_, run the following command that will guide you through a set of questions to automatically configure your instance:

    ```sh
    dolos init
    ```

    For more detailed information on how to configure Dolos, check the [configuration section](./configuration)

3. ### Bootstrap

    To bootstrap _Dolos_ (aka: sync the history of the chain), run the following command to import a Mithril snapshot:

    ```sh
    dolos bootstrap
    ```

    For more detailed information on how to bootstrap Dolos, check the [bootstrap section](./bootstrap)

4. ### Running

    Run the following command to start Dolos in `daemon` mode. This will keep runnig forever while syncing the chain from the upstream node and serving data through the APIs. 

    ```sh
    dolos daemon
    ```

    For more detailed information on different ways to run _Dolos_, check the [running section](./bootstrap)
