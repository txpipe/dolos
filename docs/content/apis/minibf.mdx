Dolos provides an HTTP endpoint to access data using [Blockfrost OpenAPI](https://github.com/blockfrost/openapi) specification.

## Coverage

## Usage

If enabled via configuration, _Dolos_ will expose a TCP port accepting HTTP connections. The default port number is `3000`, but this value can be changed via configuration.

Once you have the daemon running you can hit the endpoint using any HTTP client (cURL, Postman, your browser, etc).

This is an example of querying for the latest block using `curl`:

```shell
$ curl localhost:3000/blocks/latest | jq -S
{
  "block_vrf": "vrf_vk1wz88xjus636xa3u3qwmhwqqawf4dwed96yh7r6k9t36xtk2m635q4tfmmz",

}
```

### Using the Blockfrost SDKs

Blockfrost's SDKs can (to the most part) be adapted to be used with the Dolos MiniBF endpoint.
An example with the [Python SDK](https://github.com/blockfrost/blockfrost-python/) looks like this:

```python
import json

from blockfrost import BlockFrostApi

api = BlockFrostApi(
    project_id=None,
    base_url="http://localhost:3000",
    api_version=None,
)
api.api_version = None  # The API version defaults to "v0" on __init__.

print(json.dumps(api.block_latest().to_dict(), indent=2))
```

### Using a Tx Builder

The endpoints required for most tx builders to work are supported. Libraries like Lucid, Lucid-evolution, Blaze, MeshJS, etc can be used by pointing their corresponding provider configuration to Dolos Mini-BF endpoint.
 

## Configuration

The `serve.minibf` section controls the options for the MiniBF endpoint that can be used by clients.

| property       | type   | example      |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------ |
| listen_address | string | "[::]:3000" |

- `listen_address`: the local address (`IP:PORT`) to listen for incoming connections (`[::]` represents any IP address).

This is an example of the `serve.minibf` fragment with a `dolos.toml` configuration file.

```toml
[serve.minibf]
listen_address = "[::]:3000"
```

Some of the endpoints require extra data to be tracked by Dolos. We disable tracking all data by default since it can heavily affect the storage requirements for running Dolos.

Depending on the endpoints you want to use, you'll have to opt-in into specific dataset that you want Dolos to track.

- `seen_addresses`: Tracks whether addresses have been observed.
- `asset_state`: Monitors the state of assets.
- `pool_state`: Keeps track of the state of pools.
- `pool_delegator`: Observes delegator information for pools.
- `epoch_state`: Tracks the state of epochs.
- `account_activity`: Monitors activity related to accounts.
- `reward_logs`: Keeps track of rewards for each delegator in each epoch

Check the [Configuration Schema](../configuration/schema) for detailed info on how to setup this.
