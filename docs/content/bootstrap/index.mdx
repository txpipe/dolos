In the context of Dolos, we use the term _bootstrap_ to refer to the process of updating Dolos with the current state of the chain. This is usually a long process that involves processing a lot of data. There're ways to speed up process.

In Dolos we present a few bootstrapping options:

<CardGrid>
    <LinkCard title="Relay Node" href="./bootstrap/relay" />
    <LinkCard title="Mithril Snapshot" href="./bootstrap/mithril" />
</CardGrid>
