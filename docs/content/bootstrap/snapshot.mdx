TxPipe generates daily snapshots for the storage of Dolos. This comes in 2 varieties:

* Full: This includes the full chain history.
* Ledger: This includes only the ledger part, with a minimal WAL used to intersect against peers and continue sync.

## Execution

To execute the snapshot bootstrap procedure, you need to run the following command line:

```sh
dolos bootstrap snapshot --variant full|ledger
```

The process will take from several minutes to a few hours depending on the
network. You'll see a sequence of progress bars describing the each of the
steps of the process.

<Aside type="caution">
The process doesn't support resuming from previous runs, if you interrupt the process you'll need to start over.
</Aside>

<Aside>
The above command won't proceed if it detects that you already have data from
previous Dolos runs.
