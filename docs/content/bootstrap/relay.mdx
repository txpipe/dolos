# Bootstrap using a Public Relay

Boostrapping Dolos from a public relay node is the natural way of syncing the history of the chain but also a very slow option. It involves connecting to a single, public relay node using Ouroboros node-to-node mini-protocols and syncing the chain from origin.

<Aside type="note">
If you're looking for a faster way of bootstrapping Dolos, please refer to the alternative [Mithril](./mithril) option.
</Aside>

In essence, this bootstrapping procedure is just about starting Dolos and let it do its thing. From Dolos' perspective, the procedure involves the following:

1. Read the genesis files to load initial data
2. Connect to the configure upstream node using Ouroboros
3. Start the chain-sync mini-protocol from origin
4. Keep syncing until reaching the tip of the chain

## Configuration

To bootstrap using a public relay node, the only required configuration is the one inside the `upstream` section. You will probably have this configuration already since it's mandatory for almost every Dolos operation.

| property      | type    | example                                    |
| ------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| peer_address  | string  | "preprod-node.world.dev.cardano.org:30000" |
| network_magic | integer | 1                                          |
| is_testnet    | boolean | true                                       |

- `peer_address`: network address of peer node using `{host}:{port}` syntax.
- `network_magic`: the magic number of the network we're connecting to.
- `is_tesnet`: flag to indicate if this network is a testent or not.

This is how the configuration fragment would look like inside a `dolos.toml` file:

```toml
[upstream]
peer_address = "preprod-node.world.dev.cardano.org:30000"
network_magic = 1
is_testnet = true
```

<Aside type="note">
If you use the `dolos init` command to initialize your configuration, these values will be already populated with their defaults for each of the known networks.
</Aside>

## Execution

To start the bootstrap procedure, you need to run the following command line:

```sh
dolos sync
```

The process will take from few hours to several days depending on the network. You'll see different log outputs, some lines will indicate the _slot_  of the latest block pulled from the relay node. Compare this value to the tip of the chain as shown in a public explorer to track the overall progress.

<Aside type="note">
The process support resuming from previous runs. You can safely interrupt the process and continue again from where you left off by just running the command again.
