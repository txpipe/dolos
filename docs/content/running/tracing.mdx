Dolos can export per-transaction OpenTelemetry traces that track the full mempool lifecycle of each submitted transaction. This feature is disabled by default. When enabled, traces are sent to an OTLP-compatible collector such as Jaeger or Grafana Tempo.

## Configuration

The `[telemetry]` section in your `dolos.toml` controls trace export:

| property        | type    | default                  | description                              |
| --------------- | ------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`       | boolean | `false`                  | Enable OpenTelemetry trace export        |
| `otlp_endpoint` | string  | `"http://localhost:4317"` | gRPC endpoint of the OTLP collector      |
| `service_name`  | string  | `"dolos"`                | Service name reported in exported traces |

Example:

```toml
[telemetry]
enabled = true
otlp_endpoint = "http://localhost:4317"
service_name = "dolos"
```

## Local OTLP Setup for Testing

To get traces flowing on your local machine, you need an OTLP-compatible collector running alongside Dolos. Below are two common options.

### Option A: Jaeger all-in-one

Jaeger ships as a single Docker image that includes an OTLP gRPC receiver and a web UI.

```sh
docker run -d --name jaeger \
  -p 4317:4317 \
  -p 16686:16686 \
  jaegertracing/jaeger:latest
```

This exposes the OTLP gRPC endpoint on port `4317` and the Jaeger UI on `http://localhost:16686`.

### Option B: Grafana Tempo + Grafana

If you prefer a Grafana-based stack, use a `docker-compose.yml` like the following:

```yaml
services:
  tempo:
    image: grafana/tempo:latest
    command: ["-config.file=/etc/tempo.yaml"]
    volumes:
      - ./tempo.yaml:/etc/tempo.yaml
    ports:
      - "4317:4317"

  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana:latest
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED=true
      - GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ORG_ROLE=Admin
```

You will also need a minimal `tempo.yaml` configuration that enables the OTLP gRPC receiver. Refer to the [Grafana Tempo documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/) for details.

### Enable telemetry in Dolos

Add the `[telemetry]` block to your `dolos.toml`:

```toml
[telemetry]
enabled = true
```

The default `otlp_endpoint` (`http://localhost:4317`) matches both setups above, so you don't need to change it when running everything on the same host.

### Verify traces arrive

1. Start Dolos (`dolos daemon`).
2. Submit a transaction via gRPC or TRP.
3. Open the collector UI (Jaeger at `http://localhost:16686`, or Grafana at `http://localhost:3000`) and search for the **dolos** service.

A healthy trace shows a root span with child spans nested underneath, representing the different lifecycle stages of the transaction.

### Troubleshooting

- **Connection refused** — The collector is not running or is not listening on the expected port. Make sure the Docker container is up and port `4317` is published.
- **Wrong port** — Verify that `otlp_endpoint` points to the gRPC port (`4317` by default), not the HTTP port.
- **Firewall** — If running the collector on a different host, ensure your firewall allows inbound gRPC traffic on the configured port.

Dolos logs an error at startup if the OTLP exporter cannot reach the configured endpoint, which is the quickest way to confirm connectivity.

## Relation to Logging

Tracing is independent of the [`[logging]`](../running/logging) configuration. Both can be active simultaneously. When telemetry is disabled (the default), there is zero runtime overhead — no spans are exported and no collector connection is attempted.
