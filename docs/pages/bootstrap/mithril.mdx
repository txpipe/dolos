# Bootstrap using a Mithril Snapshot

_Mithril_ is a signature scheme that generates a certificate to convince verifiers that a portion of the stake of a system has signed a message. There's currently a network of Cardano SPOs continuosuly verifing snapshots of the history of the chain and making them available for consumption by client applications, such as Dolos.

From _Dolos'_ perspective, the process of bootsrapping with _Mihtril_ involves the following steps (which are executed automatically):

1. Downloading a snapshot from a cloud server
2. Verifying that the _Mithril_ signature is valid
3. Importing block data into Dolos' internal representation
4. Re-creating the ledger state from the chain history

## Configuration

To use _Mithril_ snapshots, _Dolos_ requires a few configuration values to download and verify data:

| property     | type   | example          |
| ------------ | ------ | ---------------- |
| aggregator   | string | "https://aggregator.release-preprod.api.mithril.network/aggregator"  |
| genesis_key | string |  "5b3...45d" (redacted) |

- `aggregator`: url of the Mithril aggregator
- `genesis_key`: hex-encoded value of the Mithril genesis key

This is how the configuration fragment would look like inside a `dolos.toml` file:

```toml
[mithril]
aggregator = "https://aggregator.release-preprod.api.mithril.network/aggregator"
genesis_key = "5b3132372c37332c3132342c3136312c362c3133372c3133312c3231332c3230372c3131372c3139382c38352c3137362c3139392c3136322c3234312c36382c3132332c3131392c3134352c31332c3233322c3234332c34392c3232392c322c3234392c3230352c3230352c33392c3233352c34345d"
```

<Callout type="info">
If you use the `dolos init` command to initialize your configuration, these values will be already populated with their defaults for each of the known networks.
</Callout>

## Execution

To execute the _Mithril_ bootstrap procedure, you need to run the following command line:

```sh
dolos bootstrap
```

The process will take from several minutes to a few hours depending on the network. You'll see a sequence of progress bars describing the each of the steps of the process.

<Callout type="warning">
The process doesn't support resuming from previous runs, if you interrupt the process you'll need to start over.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
The above command won't proceed if it detects that you already have data from previous Dolos runs. It will prompt a confirmation dialog to decide if existing data should be deleted.
</Callout>

The `bootstrap` command has a few optional arguments to help with specific scenarios:

| arg | description | default |
| --- | ----------- | ------- |
| `--download-dir <DOWNLOAD_DIR>` | Directory to store the downloaded snapshot |  `./snapshot` |
| `--skip-if-not-empty` | Skip the bootstrap if there's already data in the stores | `false` |
| `--skip-validation` | Skip the Mithril certificate validation | `false` |
| `--skip-download` | Assume the snapshot is already available in the download dir | `false` |
| `--retain-snapshot` | Retain downloaded snapshot instead of deleting it | `false` |
