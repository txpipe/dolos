# Bootstrap Procedure

In the context of Dolos, we use the term _bootstrap_ to refer to the process of updating Dolos with the current state of the chain. This is usually a long process that involves processing a lot of data. There're ways to speed up process.

In Dolos we present a few bootstrapping options:

<Cards>
    <Card title="Relay Node" arrow href="./bootstrap/relay" />
    <Card title="Mithril Snapshot" arrow href="./bootstrap/mithril" />
</Cards>
