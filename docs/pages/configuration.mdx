# Configuration

Dolos uses a toml file to manage its configuration. This config defines concerns such as toplogy, storage, APIs, logging, etc. Dolos also requires Cardano genesis data to operate. For the sake of simplicity,  we've decided to follow the schema for the existing .json files used by the Haskell node.

## Location

By default, Dolos will look for a file named `dolos.toml` in the same directory where it's being started.

If your configuration is stored at a different location, you can use specify it by passing the path in the `--config` flag, as shown in the following example:

```sh
dolos daemon --config /my/custom/location/dolos.toml
```

## Schema

This is an example configuration file for dolos:

```toml
[upstream]
peer_address = "preprod-node.world.dev.cardano.org:30000"
network_magic = 1
is_testnet = true

[storage]
path = "./data"
wal_size = 1000

[genesis]
byron_path = "./byron.json"
shelley_path = "./shelley.json"
alonzo_path = "./alonzo.json"

[sync]
pull_batch_size = 200

[submit]
prune_height = 10000
# validate_phase_1 = false
# validate_phase_2 = false

[serve.grpc]
listen_address = "[::]:50051"

[serve.ouroboros]
listen_address = "localhost:30013"

[logging]
max_level = "debug"
```

Each section of the toml controls a different aspect of Dolos' processes. The rest of this document describes in detail each of these sections.

### `upstream` section

The `upstream` section defines how to connect to the Ouroboros network to synchronize the chain and to submit transactions.

| property      | type    | example                                    |
| ------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| peer_address  | string  | "preprod-node.world.dev.cardano.org:30000" |
| network_magic | integer | 1                                          |
| is_testnet    | boolean | true                                       |

- `peer_address`: network address of peer node using `{host}:{port}` syntax.
- `network_magic`: the magic number of the network we're connecting to.
- `is_tesnet`: flag to indicate if this network is a testent or not.

### `storage` section

The `storage` section controls how Dolos stores data in the local file system. This includes immutable chain blocks, the write ahead log and the ledger state.

| property | type    | example  |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| path     | string  | "./data" |
| wal_size | integer | 1000     |

- `path`: is the root directory where all data will be stored.
- `wal_size`: is the max number entries (chain events) to keep in the write-ahead-log.

### `genesis` section

The `genesis` section indicates how to locate the different json files with genesis data for each required era. The content of the json files should match the ones used in the Haskell node.

| property     | type   | example          |
| ------------ | ------ | ---------------- |
| byron_path   | string | "./byron.json"   |
| shelley_path | string | "./shelley.json" |
| alonzo_path  | string | "./alonzo.json"  |

- `byron_path`: file path to the Byron json genesis file
- `shelley_path`: file path to the Shelley json genesis file
- `alonzo_path`: file path to the Alonzo json genesis file


### `sync` section

The `sync` section controls how Dolos synchronizes the chain from upstream peers. This involves fetch a batch of blocks from the upstream node and updating the corresponding local storage.

| property        | type    | example |
| --------------- | ------- | ------- |
| pull_batch_size | integer | 200     |
| keep_history    | boolean | true    |

- `pull_batch_szie`: the number of blocks that are fetched per batch.
- `keep_history`: flag to indicate wether the block history should be kept.

### `submit` section

The `submit` section controls how Dolos submit transactions to the network. This involves maintaining a mempool of txs and sharing them with the upstream node.

| property     | type    | example |
| ------------ | ------- | ------- |
| prune_height | integer | 60      |

- `prune_height`: the number of stacked blocks since the tx to be considered safe for pruning.

### `serve.grpc` section

The `serve.grpc` section controls the options for the gRPC endpoint that can be used by clients.

| property       | type   | example      |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------ |
| listen_address | string | "[::]:50051" |

- `listen_address`: the local address to listen for incoming gRPC connections (`[::]` represents any IPv6).

### `serve.ouroboros` section

The `serve.ouroboros` section controls the options for the Ouroboros mini-protocols endpoint that can be used by clients.

| property       | type   | example           |
| -------------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| listen_address | string | "localhost:50051" |

- `listen_address`: the local address to listen for incoming gRPC connections (`[::]` represents any IPv6).

### `logging` section

The `logging` section controls the logging options to define the level of details to output.

| property  | type   | example                             |
| --------- | ------ | ----------------------------------- |
| max_level | option | "debug" / "info" / "warn" / "error" |
