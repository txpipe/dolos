# Installation

Dolos provides different installation mechanisms depending on your requirements.

## Binary Releases

_Dolos_ can be run as a standalone executable. The [Github release](https://github.com/txpipe/dolos/releases/latest/) page includes the binaries for different OS and architectures. It's a self-contained, single-file binary that can be downloaded directly.

For simplicity, we also provide an install script that can be executed from your terminal to automate the installation process. This install script will only work for MacOS and Linux for either x86_64 and arm64 architecture. You can execute the install by running the following command from your terminal. You'll need curl and sudo access.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/txpipe/dolos/raw/main/.github/public/install.sh -o get-dolos.sh
sudo sh ./get-dolos.sh
```

## From Source

The following instructions show how to build and install _Dolos_ from source code.

### Pre-requisites

- Rust toolchain

### Procedure

```
git clone git@github.com:txpipe/dolos.git
cd dolos
cargo install --all-features --path .
```

## Docker

_Dolos_ provides already built public Docker images through Github Packages. To execute _Dolos_ via Docker, use the following command:

```sh
docker run ghcr.io/txpipe/dolos:latest
```

The result of the above command should show _Dolos'_ command-line help message.


### Entry Point

The entry-point of the image points to _Dolos_ executable. You can pass the same command-line arguments that you would pass to the binary release running bare-metal. For example:

```
docker run -it ghcr.io/txpipe/dolos:latest \
    --config my-custom-config.toml
```

For more information on available command-line arguments, check the [usage](../usage/index.md) section.


### Using a Configuration File

The default daemon configuration file for _Dolos_ is located in `/etc/dolos/daemon.toml`. To run _Dolos_ in daemon mode with a custom configuration file, you need to mount it in the correct location. The following example runs a docker container in background using a configuration file named `daemon.toml` located in the current folder:

```
docker run -d -v $(pwd)/daemon.toml:/etc/dolos/daemon.toml \
    ghcr.io/txpipe/dolos:latest daemon
```

### Versioned Images

Images are also tagged with the corresponding version number. It is highly recommended to use a fixed image version in production environments to avoid the effects of new features being included in each release (please remember dolos hasn't reached v1 stability guarantees).

To use a versioned image, replace the `latest` tag by the desired version with the `v` prefix. For example, to use version `0.6.0`, use the following image:

```
ghcr.io/txpipe/dolos:v0.6.0
```

### Multiple Architectures

_Dolos_ docker image is multi-arch, meaning that it can be used from different CPU architectures. We currently support `amd64` (aka `x86_64`) and `arm64`.

The Docker daemon will detect your architecture and use the correct manifest to run the image. The usage procedures are the same regardless of the architecture.
