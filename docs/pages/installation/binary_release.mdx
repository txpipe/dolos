# Binary Releases

_Dolos_ can be run as a standalone executable. The [Github release](https://github.com/txpipe/dolos/releases/latest/) page includes the binaries for different OS and architectures. It's a self-contained, single-file binary that can be downloaded directly.

For simplicity, we also provide an install script that can be executed from your terminal to automate the installation process. This install script will only work for MacOS and Linux for either x86_64 and arm64 architecture. You can execute the install by running the following command from your terminal. You'll need curl and sudo access.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/txpipe/dolos/raw/main/.github/public/install.sh -o get-dolos.sh
sudo sh ./get-dolos.sh
```
