# Quickstart

In this guide we're going to learn how to go from zero to a running Dolos instance with the least amount of effort.

<Steps>
### Installation

  <Tabs.Tab>  
    You can use Homebrew to install the latest version of Dolos in Mac (both x86 / ARM64)

    ```sh
    brew install txpipe/tap/dolos
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    You can install Dolos on linux system using the following command:

    ```sh
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/txpipe/dolos/releases/latest/download/dolos-installer.sh | sh
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    You can use Powershell to install Dolos on Windows systems:

    ```sh
    powershell -c "irm https://github.com/txpipe/dolos/releases/latest/download/dolos-installer.ps1 | iex"
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    _Dolos_ provides public Docker images through Github Packages. To execute _Dolos_ via Docker, use the following command:

    ```sh
    docker run ghcr.io/txpipe/dolos:latest
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

For more detailed information on how to install Dolos, check the [installation section](./installation)

### Configuration
 
To configure _Dolos_, run the following command that will guide you through a set of questions to automatically configure your instance:

```sh
dolos init
```

For more detailed information on how to configure Dolos, check the [configuration section](./configuration)

### Bootstrap
 
To bootstrap _Dolos_ (aka: sync the history of the chain), run the following command to import a Mithril snapshot:

```sh
dolos bootstrap
```

For more detailed information on how to bootstrap Dolos, check the [bootstrap section](./bootstrap)

### Running

Run the following command to start Dolos in `daemon` mode. This will keep runnig forever while syncing the chain from the upstream node and serving data through the APIs. 

```sh
dolos daemon
```

For more detailed information on different ways to run _Dolos_, check the [running section](./bootstrap)
