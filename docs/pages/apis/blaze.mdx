# Blaze

Blaze is a NodeJS library for creating Cardano transactions and off-chain code for your Aiken contracts in JavaScript. You can learn more about Blaze [in their documentation site](https://blaze.butane.dev/).

Blaze supports multiple backend providers for interacting with the Cardano network. One of those providers is `U5C` (short for UtxoRPC) which is one of the APIs suppored by Dolos. You can learn more about U5C in the [U5C documentation](./grpc.mdx).

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to use the Blaze SDK to query UTXOs for a given address using a local Dolos instance.

```ts
// Import Blaze SDK and U5C provider
import { Core, U5C } from "@blaze-cardano/sdk";

// Create a new U5C provider pointing to the local Dolos instance
const provider = new U5C({
  url: "http://localhost:50051",
});

// Query Utxos for the given address (the address in the example is a preview address randomly chosen from an explorer, use your own address)
const utxos = await provider.getUnspentOutputs(
  Core.Address.fromBech32(
    "addr_test1vpetczxy5uc9tkkqhrxgj6t0sggthyg8dd0qp22fte6wdtgvau4rn"
  )
);

// Log the UTXOs to the console
utxos.map((utxo) => {
  console.log(utxo.toCbor());
});
```
